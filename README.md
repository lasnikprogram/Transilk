### Welcome to Transilk - your go-to translation program!
Transilk is a modern and intuitive program designed to provide seamless translation services to users. 
With the help of the [FreeDict API](https://freedict.org/), the program can automatically download dictionaries and use them to provide translations for any word you input.

The main goal for this school project was to brighten up the field of translation programs with a program that looks better than the rest.
The program was tested on Ubuntu and Windows but should technically work on all Operating Systems.

## Usage
Dictionaries can simply be specified by clicking on a flag icon and typing in the [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) for the language.
The icon and dictionary for the language will be automatically downloaded. 
Users can then simply search a word by typing in the search field.

## Download
Right now only possible by building package:  
In Intellij Idea: `Build` | `Build Artifact` | `Build`, result in `out/jars/`.

Working on a reliable solution.
